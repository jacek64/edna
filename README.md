### Edna i(V0.6 1st dame) -- an MP3 server

The [original](http://edna.sourceforge.net) Edna was created by [Greg Stein](http://www.lyra.org/) February 1999, and is still the best solution for:

1. Playing your music when somebody else's PC is connected to the sound system (aka wijaaking).

2. Browsing your music as folders / files (as opposed to unknown artist / unknown album). If you're old enough, you probably remember listening to music this way.

3. Optionally - allowing friends to download songs or zipped folders from your music collection.

#### Install

* `cp edna-example.conf edna.conf`

* Edit `edna.conf` (at least define `dir1`)

#### Run

* Run `./edna.py`

* Browse to it from wherever the speakers are :)

Easy.

usage instructions.
